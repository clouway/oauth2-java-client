# OAuth2 java client
A client library which uses oauth client secrets to send authorized requests or generate access tokens

### OAuth2 client for console apps 

##### Send authorized request, with access token generated by Google OAuth server, using google http client library 

```java
OАuthClientConfig config = OАuthClientConfig
       .setClient("::client::")
       .setSecret("::secret::")
       .setScopes(setOf("scope1", "scope2"))
       //you can pass other implementation of CredentialsStore, like - CredentialsDatabase
       .setCredentialsStorage(LocalCredentialsFileStorage(filePath))
       .build()
             
HttpRequestFactory factory = NetHttpTransport().createRequestFactory(
         BearerTokenInterceptor.newGoogleInterceptor(config))
 
 // do HTTP call
 ```
 
 NOTE: your client should have redirect url : 'http://localhost:8089/oauth2callback'
 
 NOTE: if this code is invoked by gradle task(groovy) you task should contain this line:
 'standardInput = System.in' or Scanner object will throw exception.

       .setCredentialsStorage(LocalCredentialsFileStorage(filePath))
       .build()
